# Minecraft Purge

The Minecraft Purge plugin brings the purge to Minecraft. After activating the Purge, for a specified amount of time all PvP will be legal, and protected zones won't protect you from PvP anymore. While the purge is going on, a scoreboard will be show with the top 3 players, and the amount off kills and deaths you have.
